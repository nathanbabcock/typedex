## Features

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Typesafety" icon="approve-check-circle">
    Indexed DB's idiosyncracies are enforced through the type system, catching a
    wide range of potential errors at compile-time before they happen.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Declarative migrations" icon="list-format">
    Use a fluent builder interface to set up your database, capturing granular
    information about the schema and database architecture while you do so.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Schema validation*" icon="seti:json">
    Define and validate the shape of your data with best-in-class schema
    libraries like [`zod`](http://zod.dev/).
    <small>
      *only Zod for now, with full [Standard
      Schema](https://standardschema.dev/) support coming soon ;)
    </small>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Thin wrapper" icon="puzzle">
    Since most of the functionality is compile-time, there is little to no
    runtime overhead and minimal impact on bundle size. Under the hood, the
    excellent [`idb`](https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb) library is used as a
    minimal, ergonomic, and modern interface for Indexed DB.
